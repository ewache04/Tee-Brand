## 🎨 Design Concept

### 👕 Front Design: Playful Statement

- **Quote:**  
  _“Ooh, look at these two… cheaters? Or just shy?”_

- **Font:**  
  Bold sans-serif (e.g., Druk Bold, Montserrat ExtraBold, Helvetica Neue Condensed Bold) for “Ooh, look at these two…”; handwritten script (e.g., Brush Script) for “cheaters?” and “shy?”.

- **Placement:**  
  Horizontally and vertically centered on the chest

- **Color Options:**  
  - **Primary:** Black tee with white text for “Ooh, look at these two…”, neon pink for “cheaters?”, electric blue for “shy?”, and a white winking eye emoji below “shy?”  
  - **Alternate:** White tee with black text for a reversed look

- **Styling:**  
  Clean layout with a winking eye emoji (1-inch) below “shy?” and a subtle black-on-black embroidered ace of spades (0.5-inch) on the left sleeve for a “cheaters” nod. No additional logos on front to maintain focus.

### 🖼 Back Design: Narrative Animation Graphic

#### Concept  
A vertical 3-frame comic-style sequence illustrating a subtle moment of intimacy that leaves observers unsure of what they’ve seen.

#### Frame Breakdown (Stacked Top to Bottom):
1. **Frame 1:**  
   - Two silhouette figures (male and female) standing slightly apart  
   - Neutral body language  
   - Caption: *“Just standing...”*

2. **Frame 2:**  
   - Male’s arm gently around female’s waist  
   - She leans in slightly  
   - Caption: *“Now he’s getting comfortable...”*

3. **Frame 3:**  
   - Figures are cuddled together  
   - Optional heart or ellipsis above heads  
   - Caption: *“...and we’re left wondering.”*

#### Art Style
- **Silhouettes:** Clean, faceless outlines for universality  
- **Linework:** Thin and intentional — no over-detailing  
- **Color Palette:** Monochrome (black/white/gray) with optional blush/beige accents  
- **Mood:** Observational, intimate, slightly mysterious

## 🧠 Production Notes

- **Printing:** Heat transfer or high-quality screen printing recommended for the front quote; embroidery for the ace of spades on the sleeve  
- **Scalability:** Works on oversized tees and hoodies  
- **Layout:** Balanced front design with emoji and sleeve detail; back frames spaced for natural visual flow  
- **Branding Touch:** Optional small logo (e.g., *Unspoken Threads – Vol. 01*) at bottom hem or inner neck

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Demographic:** Ages 18–35, streetwear enthusiasts, meme-aware, socially engaged
